# Object-Package
Contains the object package. Please use the branches for commits.

  For proper usage of the package, use the following steps:
  1.  Extract the files (obviously)
  2.  Move the inner folder out of the outer folder
  3.  Rename the inner folder 'objects' (without the apostrophes)
  4.  Place the 'objects' folder into 'src' folder of your project
  5.  Under the 'package' line in your project, write the line 'import objects.*'
